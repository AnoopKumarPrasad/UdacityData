SMART Asthma Alert using IoT and Decision Tree Classifier
Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.
Effects include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.
These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.
Data Mining concept of Decision tree classifier helps us understand the nature of the triggers and 
thus helps us in setting up the threshold for the patient. 
Decision trees are an important tool for developing classification or predictive analytics models related to analyzing big data or
data science.
The presence of redundant attributes does not adversely affect the construction of the Decision Tree. 
Here, while collecting data we get many redundant sets of data points too. 
The prediction of another episode of asthma attacks can be further analyzed using Machine Learning prediction.

# 2. Motivation

In this project, I use the data to answer 2 health questions:

a. This analysis will help many health care industry.

b. The outcome as a alert device will help to many patients to cure themselves and live a better lifestyle.


# 3. File Descriptions
I am well - versed with Python and R . Due to library package , I have used R Studio. I have attached plot diagram recieved with it.
